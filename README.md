# Forest Fire Detection using Deep Learning 🔥🌲

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to develop a deep learning-based image classification model to detect forest fires. Implemented as part of the Shell-Edunet Skills4Future AICTE Internship (April 2025), the solution leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify images as *fire* or *non-fire*, assisting in early warning systems for environmental disaster management.

## 🔍 Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Gathered a dataset of forest fire and non-fire images.
2. **Preprocessing**: Resized images, normalized pixel values, and split into training and testing sets.
3. **Model Building**: Created a CNN model using Keras with layers for convolution, pooling, and dense classification.
4. **Training & Evaluation**: Trained the model and evaluated it using accuracy, precision, and confusion matrix.
5. **Prediction**: Deployed model on sample test images to demonstrate real-time classification.
